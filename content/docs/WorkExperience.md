## I have been with Microsoft since I started working.

### 2018 to 2021 (March)
Supported enterprise customers to resolve their issues with O365 and Teams servers.

### 2021 (April) to 2022 (April) 
During this period I worked in the blue team of Microsoft where I used a lot of investigation tools to defend the corporate network against bad actors.

### 2022 (May) to present 
I am working in the hardware benchmarking space where we validate hardware use cases for deployment to production.
